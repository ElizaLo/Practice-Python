- ## `for` loop
  - The iterable is the object that you will parsing through in a for loop. Generally, this object does not change while the for loop is being executed.

  - The iterator (loop) variable is the variable which stores a portion of the iterable when the for loop is being executed. Each time the loop iterates, the value of the iterator variable will change to a different portion of the iterable.
